"""Strategy evaluator — the pure heart of the betting engine.

The :func:`evaluate` function takes a betfairlightweight ``MarketBook`` and
the strategy portion of a plugin config, and returns a :class:`BetDecision`
(or list of them) describing the bet(s) the strategy wants to place — or a
:class:`NoBet` explaining why nothing was bet.

This module is identical to the Backtest Tool's ``evaluator.py``. FSU100
deliberately shares this code so a strategy validated in backtest behaves
identically in live trading.

Critical properties:

* **Pure**. The function has no side effects: no I/O, no clock reads, no
  randomness. The same inputs always produce the same outputs.
* **Configuration-driven**. Every threshold, band, stake, and toggle is
  read from the supplied config. There are zero hardcoded strategy rules
  and zero string matches on rule names — rules are iterated as a list,
  matched mechanically by ``odds_band`` (and optional ``gap_lt`` /
  ``gap_gte``), and their ``name`` is treated as a label for reporting
  only. A plugin with rules called ``banana_1`` and ``banana_2`` runs
  through exactly the same code path as one with rules called
  ``rule_1`` and ``rule_2``.
* **Robust to missing data**. Missing prices, empty runner lists, in-play
  markets, and other degenerate inputs are turned into :class:`NoBet`
  results with descriptive reasons.

    Args:
        market_book: A betfairlightweight ``MarketBook`` instance. Only the
            attributes documented in this module are accessed, so any
            duck-typed object with the same shape is acceptable.
        strategy: Either a :class:`StrategyConfig` or a raw mapping that
            validates against it. Accepting both keeps callers simple.
        point_value: Multiplier converting rule stake/base_stake into
            currency-denominated stake. Defaults to ``1.0``.
        filters_country: Optional country whitelist; if non-empty, markets
            outside the list are skipped.
        filters_market_type: Optional market type whitelist; if non-empty,
            other market types are skipped.

    Returns:
        A list of :class:`EvaluationResult`. Most rules produce a single
        result; rules with ``also_lay_2nd`` may produce two
        :class:`BetDecision` entries. A non-betting outcome is returned as
