"""Outputs produced by the strategy evaluator.

The evaluator is a pure function. For each market it returns either a
:class:`BetDecision` describing a bet to place, or a :class:`NoBet` carrying
the reason the market was skipped. Both are immutable, frozen dataclasses
so callers cannot mutate the result.

This module is identical to the Backtest Tool's ``models/decisions.py`` —
FSU100 reuses the same evaluator and therefore the same decision shapes.
